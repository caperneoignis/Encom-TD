Jonathan Eubank CS350 Project Journal

2/5
--group met with Dr. Ribler, selected Tower Defense as project
--created initial stories for pivotal tracker

2/6
--group discussed which programming language to use
--eventually chose C#
--added some stories to points
--began researching game engine platforms, picked Unity
--began exploring Unity and learning features

2/7
--had group meeting
--decided on monkey/balloon theme for game
--began discussing game features, such as unit upgrades, level design, and difficulty

2/13
--watched a lot of Unity tutorials online, learned about graphics/textures, unity keywords, sprites

2/14
--began working on initial unit pathfinding for balloons to navigate level

2/19
--researched unit-testing software for Unity/C#

2/20
--began initial sprite development
--began small unit-testing (if statements w/ prints)
--had teleconference with Vietnamese group

2/25
--began working on collision detection for balloons (hit waypoint and begin to move to next)

2/27
--group project development in class

3/3
--began working on unit-tracking for turret

3/9
--continued work on balloon navigation and unit-tracking for turret

3/17
--attempted to begin unit-testing with Unity Test Tools, but experienced great difficulty implementing it into the software, program would not run

3/27
--switched back to manual testing using if statements and prints
--improved turret accuracy and gave turrets a range


3/28
--made balloons die on turret hit (turrets can multikill balloons)
--worked some more on balloon targeting (trying to kill first in line rather than closest)

4/1
--worked on our unit-testing issues some more, tried to use Visual Studio to unit test but failed due to unique nature of Unity keywords (Unity-specific classes)

4/4
--began working on initial geometric functions for balloon targeting

4/9
--met with Dr. Ribler, got advice on possible way to unit-test
--began unit-testing on functions we could call (such as geometric targeting functions)

4/12
--worked on targeting functions some more
--began group discussion on creating a GUI for menu to place monkeys on board

4/17
--finished balloon sprites, incorporated into game
--implemented balloon spawner to spawn a single wave 
--got wave of balloons to follow path

4/21
--began implementation of new geometric targeting system for turrets after completion of unit-testing
--finished unit-testing and design for monkey targeting system
4/25
--began planning phase of making game instance into a singleton
--encountered difficulty trying to implement singleton
--removed monkey multikill ability by destroying bullet after kill

4/30
--finished implementing new targeting system for monkey
--created multiple waves of balloons that spawn after 10 second interval
--created life counter that tracks if balloon reaches end of path
--created score counter that tracks balloon kills
--began working on menu GUI to spawn monkeys on click (to place them on the board)
--began working on drag/drop implementation for monkeys


Note: all tasks listed were done using pair programming with Kevin Midkiff, except for the Unity tutorials on 2/13
